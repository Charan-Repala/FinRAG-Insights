# FinBOT - Agentic RAG Chatbot

FinBOT is an advanced chatbot application built with **Streamlit** and **CrewAI**, leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques. It offers a versatile platform where users can interact with an AI model in multiple modes: chatting directly with a language model, querying content from uploaded PDFs, or fetching live financial data. The application supports multiple chat sessions, PDF indexing for semantic search, and real-time data retrieval from financial APIs, making it a powerful tool for financial analysis and research.

## How It Works

### Chat with LLM

- **Technology:** Uses Gemini AI via `google-generativeai`.
- **Mechanism:** Maintains session history for context. Messages are streamed dynamically.
- **Storage:** History saved in `RAG/data/` as serialized files.

### Chat with PDF

- **Technology:**
  - MarkItDown extracts text.
  - SemanticChunker splits content.
  - SentenceTransformer generates embeddings.
  - Qdrant stores/searches chunks.

- **Mechanism:** Uploaded PDFs are indexed into Qdrant collections. Queries are matched semantically.

- **Output:** Relevant chunks synthesized into coherent answers.

### Chat with Live Data

- **Technology:**
  - CrewAI agents orchestrate tools.
  - YahooFinanceTool, NewsAPITool, CryptoAPITool.

- **Mechanism:** Analyzes queries, fetches data, and formats with source attribution.

- **Output:** Formatted responses with real-time data.

### Research Proposal Generation

- **Technology:** CrewAI agents + tools.
  - YFinanceHistoricalTool (stock data)
  - SerperDevTool (news)
  - FPDF (PDF generation)

- **Mechanism:**
  - Research Agent: Collects info.
  - Analysis Agent: Finds trends.
  - Report Agent: Generates PDF.

- **Output:** PDF reports stored in `pages/proposals/`.
